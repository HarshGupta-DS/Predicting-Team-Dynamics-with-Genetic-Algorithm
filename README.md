# Predicting-Team-Dynamics-with-Genetic-Algorithm



#PROBLEM STATEMENT

To classify an individual as an aggressive or a passive personality and to find an optimal number of Aggressive and Passive personalities in a team using genetic algorithms. 

#ABSTRACT

Allocating people in multiple projects is an important issue considering the efficiency of groups from the point of view of social interaction. In the proposed methodology, based on previous works, an optimal number of people with aggressive and passive personality traits are being found. To solve the resulting optimization problem we propose a Genetic Algorithm due to the NP-hard nature of the problem. Social cohesion is an important issue that directly impacts the productivity of the work environment. In academic institutions as well, team work has been seen as a good preparation for students to enter the industry because by working in a team, they can improve their ability to manage and solve project problems efficiently. Most courses in a university normally adopt the team structure as a means for students to share their knowledge, enhance problem solving skills and improve communication skills. However, not all student teams work well. One of the reasons is the teams are not systematically formed. Therefore, team formation is very important as a starting point for the group development and performance. So, maintaining an appropriate level of cohesion keeps a group together, which will bring positive impacts on the results of a project. There are a variety of team formation techniques that have been investigated by researchers. However, in normal practice, self-selection and random assignment of members are the most popular approaches used in team formation. Unfortunately, these two approaches are not useful in most of the development teams because it will not speed up the development processes. Therefore, the aim of the proposal is to ensure the best possible effectiveness from the point of view of social interaction. In this way, the presented algorithm serves as a decision-making tool for managers to build teams of people in multiple projects. In order to analyze the performance of the proposed method, computational experiments with benchmarks were performed and compared with the exhaustive method. The results are promising and show that the algorithm generally obtains near-optimal results within a short computational time.

#OBJECTIVE

The objective of the project is to find an optimal number of Aggressive and Passive personalities in a team using genetic algorithms and a formulation to estimate payoff expectations that has to be provided. This project also classifies a person into aggressive and passive personalities. The aim of the project is to ensure the best possible effectiveness from the point of view of social interaction. To solve this optimization problem we propose a Genetic Algorithm. Social behaviour is an important issue that directly impacts the productivity of the work environment. In academic institutions as well, team work has been seen as a good preparation for students to enter the industry because by working in a team, they can improve their ability to manage and solve project problems efficiently. In this way, the presented algorithm serves as a decision-making tool for managers to build teams of people in multiple projects. 


#PROBLEMS IN THE EXISTING SYSTEMS

The existing systems predict the team size and methods of team formation quite well, but these systems consider a lot of characteristics like skills, communication characteristics, authority, roles, etc. Hence, this leads to a complex process of team composition prediction. 

#PROPOSED SOLUTION

The proposed solution will focus on effectively classifying a person as a passive or an aggressive personality using Machine Learning. By taking these two personalities, an optimal solution for the composition of the team is going to be generated. Different scenarios are to be considered for this prediction. The three different scenarios are: More number of aggressive genes, more number of passive genes and equal number of passive and aggressive genes. 

#SCOPE OF WORK 

Positive team dynamics can bring a lot of benefits to a project. A team operating to its fullest potential is naturally going to get better results. They are more focused, clearer on their aims and most importantly work better together. Great levels of collaboration and cooperation are possible when a team works in a more informal and supportive atmosphere. In a team with a good proportion of different personalities, the team members are more willing to listen to each other and so make faster decisions. To be able to predict such a team is of great importance in any corporation, college, university etc. 


#IMPLEMENTATION

Genetic Algorithms mimic all the processes based on the concept of natural evolution to find the optimum solution to the given problem residing in the search space. According to evolutionary theories, the chromosomes which only have good fitness are likely to survive and to generate offspring and pass its strength to them by the genetic operator.
 
This square represents the condition for survival for when 2 individuals meet ie when 2 aggressive genes meet they fight and lose the resource, when 2 passives meet they share their food and split the resource in half, when 1 aggressive and one passive meet then the aggressive steals the entire resource.
As the generations pass there will not be enough resources so the fittest will survive or reproduce in doing so will give rise population differences between the 2 types of individuals.

This process can be simulated to be understood. The simulation is done in Unity by using the genetic algorithm.  The code is written in C#. 

Decision tree classifiers are regarded to be a standout of the most well-known methods to data classification representation of classifiers. Different researchers from various fields and backgrounds have considered the problem of extending a decision tree from available data, such as machine study, pattern recognition, and statistics. In various fields such as medical disease analysis, text classification, user smartphone classification, images, and many more the employment of Decision tree classifiers has been proposed in many ways. 

While implementing the decision tree we will go through the following two phases:
 1. Building Phase
●	Preprocess the dataset.
●	Split the dataset from train and test using Python sklearn package.
●	Train the classifier.

 2. Operational Phase
●	Make predictions.
●	Calculate the accuracy

#CONCLUSION

An approach for calculating the number of aggressive and passive personalities in a group has been developed using genetic algorithms. There may be various combinations that exist so pitching an optimal solution is inevitable. Therefore, genetic algorithms can be tailored to solve this problem. The most successful organisms maximize their payoff and increase their ability to reproduce. In short, the organism with the best interaction strategy has the highest fitness. Essentially, we will find that in situations like this, the individuals or the population as a whole must display a mixture of the two behaviors in order to have any chance of being stable.
